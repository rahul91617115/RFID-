# RFID-
A cheerful little system that welcomes students with a smile (and a green LED)! SmartGuard uses RFID magic to track attendance while politely opening/closing a tiny door. No more paper lists or "Did I forget to sign in?" moments!

Why You'll Love It
No more "Did you take attendance?" – Automatically logs students as they enter

Happy green light = Welcome! – Friendly visual feedback

Goodbye, awkward door-holding! – The tiny door opens/closes like magic

Perfect memory – Never forgets who came to class (unlike us humans!)





*How It Works in Real Life
Student taps card → Happy beep!

Green LED lights up → "Welcome, friend!"

Servo opens door → "Come on in!"

Motion sensor sees you enter → "Gotcha! Door closing now."




*Want to make it even friendlier?

Add voice greetings?

Let it tweet when students arrive?

Make the door dance?

Pull requests welcome!
